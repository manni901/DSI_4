Project 4-2 Submission
Please read the following information.

For a look at the code I have added the following files:
- QueryNode.h
- QueryNode.cc
- QueryPlan.h
- QueryPlan.cc
- ParseUtil.h
- QueryNodeTest.cc

To run various queries, I have taken 10 query plan queries from project 5 files.
In the folder QueryPlanTest/ you will find 10 files q[1-10].txt each with a single query.
To run the test please run the following shell script:
$ sh QueryPlanTestRunner.sh

This script builds the executable ./QueryNode_Test and calls it 10 times, one for each file and
writes the output in QueryPlantTestOut/ as q[1-10]-out.txt
