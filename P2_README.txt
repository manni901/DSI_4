Project 1, Prashant Mishra (UFID 7879-9401):

I have added the following new code files:
- BigQ.h
- BigQ.cc
- BigQ_Test (contains gtest based unit test for TPMMS sorting using BigQ)

And edited:
- Makefile (Added two new executable test2-1.out and BigQ_Test)

To run BigQ_Test which uses gtest simply run:

$ make BigQ_Test
$ ./BigQ_Test
